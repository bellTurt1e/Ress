    <p>
    Hi my name is Raymond Bell and I'm currently attending CSUSB for a Bachelors in Computer Science. As of 2021 I'm in my second year and currently on track to graduate in 2023.
    My hobbies include hiking, paint, adventure / explore new places, programming with my Arduino, playing Beat Saber, Longboarding, and gardening.
    I'm most proficient in C++ however I'd like to learn ruby to learn app development.

    <h1>My Goal</h1>

    <p>
    My goal in the next 4 years is to become a software engineer and bring something amazing to the tab in terms of programming and overall personality. I want to bring my uplifting personality to those in need and motivate them to want more and strive to new heights. My creativity know no bounds and has helped me get to this point in life. It's also helped me become a better programmer by making me ask abstract questions. By asking these questions I've grown and I cant wait to grow with a team.
