    <h1>Experience at Turtle Knight</h1>
    <section>
      <p>
        Turtle Knight is a team unity project for CSE 4550 based at Cal State San Bernardino, CA, where I served as a Software Engineer from January 2022 to May 2022. In this role, I contributed significantly to the development of the game by leveraging my skills in Git and GitHub for collaborative version control through branch management.
        The game itself is a 2-D side scroller, depicting the journey of a turtle determined to rid the world of trash. My responsibilities included creating UI elements, animations, sprite sheets, and addressing bugs related to physics and animations.
        Furthermore, I implemented event-based programming in C#, crafting scripts to establish health systems, boss animations, and event triggers, thereby enhancing the overall gameplay experience.
