    <h1>Dexcom Internship Overview<br> Tittle: DevOps Engineer Intern</h1>
    <p>
      During my time at Dexcom, I played a crucial role in developing a system that extracts data from GitHub/GCP using GitHub Actions to track employee work and progress.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Overview Of My Intern Project</h1>
    <section>
      <p>
        I helped build a system that grabs data from GitHub/GCP via GitHub Actions to track employee work/progress. This program was essential as everyone's pay was salary-based, not hourly. Engineers had the flexibility to work at any time as long as their tasks were completed. The collected data was processed through three Python scripts within a GCP cloud function, resulting in a clean CSV file. This CSV file underwent review and approval by two auditors, Mark Juric and Gal, professional auditors.
      </p>

    <h1>Secondary Project</h1>
    <p>
      - Scripted the automation of audits using Python, generating CSV files for audit approval.<br>
      - Extracted data from Google Cloud Platform Kubernetes clusters and projects through terminal commands.<br>
      - Implemented the launch of Cloud Functions using GitHub Actions for future continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) processes.<br>
      - Automated the audit process by utilizing GitHub Actions and scheduling it to run via cron.<br>
      - Created and managed GitHub secrets in various environments, granting GitHub Actions the necessary permissions through Personal Access Tokens (PAT).
    </p>

    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>
      - Developed a system to track employee work/progress using GitHub/GCP integration.<br>
      - Automated audit processes using Python, GitHub Actions, and GCP cloud functions.<br>
