    <h1>Walgreens Internship Overview<br>Tittle: Azure DevOps Engineer Intern</h1>
    <p>
      During my time at Walgreens, I was heavily involved in deploying and managing various Azure services 
      to support the company's infrastructure and application development processes.

    <h1>Overview Of My Intern Project</h1>
    <section>
    <p>
      My primary project involved the creation of a comprehensive wiki page tailored for engineers. To streamline this process, I developed a robust pipeline within Azure DevOps, which engineers could seamlessly integrate into their workflow.
      This pipeline was designed to automatically trigger upon each push made via GIT. It diligently scanned through the engineers' JSON templates, README, Markdown, and XML files to detect any modifications. Upon identifying changes, the pipeline swiftly initiated the creation of a dedicated folder within the wiki, aptly named after their respective project. Subsequently, it meticulously added their updated documentation to the designated folder.
      Through this streamlined process, engineers could effortlessly maintain and update their project documentation, ensuring that the wiki remained an invaluable resource hub for all team members.

  <h1>Secondary Project</h1>
    
    <p>
      For my secondary project, I spearheaded the launch of a secure, private website accessible exclusively to authorized personnel within the designated resource group, leveraging Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Azure.
      Utilizing Azure DevOps for seamless deployment, the website was meticulously configured to provide key insights and analytics, enabling me to closely monitor performance metrics and effectively manage costs.
      Thanks to RBAC implementation, stringent access controls were enforced, ensuring that only individuals within the permitted resource group could access the website. Additionally, advanced security measures were implemented, including assignment of a subnet mask, further bolstering the website's integrity and safeguarding sensitive information.
